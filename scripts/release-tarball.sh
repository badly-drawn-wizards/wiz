# A release tarball of the Wiz toolchain (stage 26d): what `tower` installs from GitHub
# Releases, and what you can untar by hand.
#
#   scripts/release-tarball.sh OUT.tar.gz [BINDIR] [REVISION] [CCDIR] [WEBDIR]
#
# BINDIR (default .lake/build/bin) holds the built wiz, grail and tower; the standard
# library, the nvim plugin and the docs come from this checkout. CCDIR is the C toolchain
# made by scripts/bundle-cc.sh (stage 26f; the release job passes it); WEBDIR the web
# infoview built by web/build.sh (11r: `wiz lsp` serves it). The tarball is one
# directory, wiz-ARCH-linux/:
#
#   bin/wiz, bin/grail       wrappers: the binary with -I share/wiz/lib (no other flags:
#                            `wiz build` uses share/wiz/cc when it is there, else `cc` and
#                            the system's GMP; tower rewrites them with your flags)
#   bin/tower                the toolchain manager
#   share/wiz/lib/           the standard library
#   share/wiz/.lake/build/bin/{wiz,grail}   the binaries (grail finds lib/ from there)
#   share/wiz/editors/       the editor plugins, when the checkout has them
#   share/wiz/cc/            the C compiler, glibc 2.27 sysroot, static GMP and GC (CCDIR)
#   share/wiz/web/           the web infoview: page, script, Wasm (WEBDIR)
#   share/wiz/REVISION       the commit
#   share/wiz/LICENSE, COPYING.RUNTIME, NOTICE   Wiz's licence, the runtime exception,
#                            and what third-party code is in the toolchain
#                            (scripts/release-licenses/NOTICE, beside this script)
#   share/wiz/LICENSES/      third-party licence texts: Lean's (lean --print-prefix, when
#                            there is a lean) and scripts/release-licenses/*-LICENSE
#   share/wiz/TOOLCHAIN      a marker: editors find the toolchain a library file belongs to
#
# OUT.tar.gz.sha256 is written next to it.
