# Building, testing and CI

## Building and testing

```sh
lake build          # the library and the `wiz` executable
lake test           # all exercise tests; every case runs in its own process
lake test -- conv   # only the groups whose name starts with "conv"
lake test -- =c     # only the group named exactly "c"
lake test -- '=selfhost#0,3'          # only cases 0 and 3 of the group "selfhost"
lake test -- --list                   # the group names
lake test -- --list-cases =selfhost   # the selected cases: GROUP<tab>INDEX<tab>NAME
lake test -- --timings t.jsonl rig    # also append each case's time to t.jsonl
.lake/build/bin/tests --run selfhost 3  # one case (also selfhost#3): exit 0 passed, 1 failed, 3 skipped
```

Every case prints its wall time (`✓ name (12.345 s)`), and every group its total.
`--timings FILE` (with `--shard NAME` as a label) appends one line of JSON per case:
`shard`, `group`, `index`, `case`, `seconds`, `ok`, and `notes`, which say which shared
programs the case used and built (`Tests.note`: `uses checker`, `built checker 331.2`;
the self-hosted checker and compiler are built by the first case that needs them and
kept under `/tmp`).

An unimplemented exercise shows up as `✗ ... not implemented yet (hit a sorry)`. A case
that cannot run here (no C toolchain, no `nix`, …) calls `Tests.skip REASON` and shows up
as `⊘ name` with `skipped (REASON)`; the total counts it apart (`…, 2 skipped`), and it is
not a pass. A selector that picks no group, a case index the group lacks, and an unknown
flag are errors (exit code 2), not an empty run.

`tests --run GROUP INDEX` runs one case as `lake test -- '=GROUP#INDEX'` does: in a child
process, with the toolchain of `grail.local.wiz` (toolchain flags after it override it),
printing the case's name and result, a failure's output, and a last line
`GROUP #INDEX: passed|FAILED|SKIPPED`. Build the driver first (`lake build wiz tests`):
plain `lake build` does not, and a stale driver runs whichever case had that index.

**Embedded files.** Lake does not track files a module reads with `include_str`, so each
embedded file gets a library of its own whose `needs` names the file as an
`input_file` (`lakefile.toml`): Lake mixes the file's content hash into that library's
module traces, so editing the file rebuilds the embedding module and its importers, and
the artifact cache never serves a stale one. The only one today is the C runtime:
`runtime/wiz.c`, embedded by `runtime/WizRuntime.lean` (library `WizRuntime`, imported by
`Wiz/Compiler/C.lean`). A new `include_str` goes in such a library too, not in `Wiz`
(a `needs` on `Wiz` would rebuild all of it); `scripts/test-embed.sh` checks the setup (CI runs it in the build job).

## What `wiz build` links

`wiz build` turns a program into C (or LLVM IR) and hands it to a C compiler with the
runtime (`runtime/wiz.c`), which needs GMP; programs from the self-hosted compiler also
need the Boehm GC. The release toolchains (what tower installs) bring all of that in
`share/wiz/cc` (docs/stages/26-tower.md, 26f): clang, a glibc 2.27 sysroot, and GMP and the
GC as static libraries (the bundled clang needs glibc 2.30 or later; programs it builds
need glibc 2.27 or later and nothing else), and CaDiCaL, the SAT solver of `sat_decide`
(docs/stages/28-solvers.md, 28b), which writes LRAT proofs (the Lean toolchain's copy, MIT
licence, in `share/wiz/cc/LICENSES/lean4-LICENSES` with Lean's third-party licences; z3 is
not bundled). A checkout uses `cc` and the system's GMP unless you pass
`--cc`/`--cflags`/`--ldflags` (the Nix dev shell writes them to `grail.local.wiz`).

**Licences of what is linked into your programs.** The Wiz Runtime Library Exception
(COPYING.RUNTIME) lets you distribute programs compiled by Wiz under any terms, but it
covers only Wiz's own runtime. Other libraries keep their licences:

* **GMP** is under the LGPL-3.0-or-later (or GPL-2.0-or-later). The release toolchain
  links it **statically**, as Lean does for Lean programs. If you give someone a binary
  built that way under terms that are not the (L)GPL, the LGPL asks you to: say that the
  program uses GMP and include the GNU LGPL and GPL texts (they are in
  `share/wiz/cc/LICENSES/`); offer GMP's source (or say where to get it); and let the
  recipient relink your program with a modified GMP, which for a static binary means also
  providing your program's object files (or its source). If your program's source is
  public anyway, you have done the last part already. Using programs yourself, or in a
  company without giving them to others, creates no obligations.
* With **dynamic** GMP only the notice and the source offer remain, because the user can
  replace `libgmp.so`. To build that way, use the system's compiler and GMP:
  `--cc gcc` (with `libgmp-dev` installed; tower: `tower set cc gcc`).
* The **Boehm GC** (self-hosted runtime) has an MIT-style licence: keep its notice
  (`share/wiz/cc/LICENSES/bdwgc-README.QUICK`).
* glibc is linked dynamically, as with any C program. The compiler-rt builtins clang
  links in (Apache-2.0 with LLVM exception) need no notice.

A release toolchain's `share/wiz/NOTICE` says the same, and also lists the third-party
code linked into `wiz`, `grail` and `tower` themselves; the licence texts are in
`share/wiz/LICENSES/` and `share/wiz/cc/LICENSES/`.

## Continuous integration

`nix develop` gives the toolchain the tests need besides Lean (see `flake.nix`): GMP and
LLVM's `llc` for the C and LLVM backends, Boehm GC for the self-hosted backend, a C
compiler, and elan, which installs the Lean in `lean-toolchain`. Entered at the
repository root, it writes this machine's paths to the uncommitted `grail.local.wiz`,
which grail and the test driver read (`Tests/Main.lean`; flags to `lake test -- …` win);
`wiz` takes flags. Nothing reads environment variables.

GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs on pushes and pull requests to
`master`. Every job runs in that dev shell (with the Cachix cache, when
one is configured); the elan toolchain and `.lake` (including Lake's artifact cache) are
cached between runs.

* **The test suite** runs in parallel shards, one job per entry of `.github/test-shards.json` (each entry
  is a list of `lake test` selectors). The build job checks that every group of
  `Tests/Main.lean` is in exactly one shard (`scripts/ci.py check-shards`, which checks
  every case after splitting), so **a new test group must be added to
  `.github/test-shards.json`** (one selector per line, sorted within its shard) and to
  the `groups` list at the end of its test module (`Tests/*.lean`, one group per line,
  sorted; `Tests/Main.lean` only concatenates the modules' lists). Both are laid out so
  that branches adding different groups don't touch the same lines. Each shard's job summary has a table of every case's time
  (three decimals), group subtotals and the shard's total; the `CI result` job sums the
  shards up (a table of shard totals and the grand total, and the 15 slowest cases) and
  uploads every case's time as the `test-timings` artifact.
* **Split shards.** A shard with `"split": N` runs as N jobs `NAME-1` … `NAME-N`, each a
  list of `=GROUP#I,J,…` selectors. `scripts/ci.py` balances the parts with the case
  times in `.github/test-timings.json`: the cases that use the same shared program (the
  self-hosted checker or compiler, which the first case that needs it builds) stay in
  one part, so each program is built once, and the other cases fill the parts up. A new
  case counts as its group's median, with the programs most of its group uses. The
  baseline holds only the split shards' cases, one per line (`selfhost` and `library`).
  `scripts/ci.py plan` shows the parts and their
  estimates. To refresh the baseline from a CI run:
  `gh run download RUN -n test-timings && scripts/ci.py baseline timings.jsonl > .github/test-timings.json`.
* **Shard balance.** CI's wall time is its longest job, so the invariant is that **no
  test shard's test time is over 1.5× the median shard's**. Every split shard's cases
  have an entry in `.github/test-timings.json`, and no shared program is built by two
  parts of one split shard. It is tracked in two places:
  * `scripts/ci.py check-shards` (the build job) warns when a split shard has cases
    that are not in the baseline.
  * `scripts/ci.py balance` (the `CI result` job) checks the run's measured case times.
    It adds a "Shard balance" table to the run summary and a warning annotation for each
    violation.

  Both only warn, on pull requests and on master. A new case has no time until a CI run
  has measured it, and runner times vary, so a failure here would block merges that are
  correct.

  On a master push whose tests all passed and whose balance drifted, the `CI result`
  job uploads the regenerated baseline as the `test-timings-baseline` artifact. It also
  prints the command that applies it, in the warning and in the summary:
  `gh run download RUN -R wiz-pl/wiz -n test-timings-baseline -D .github`.
  Commit the result in a small PR. CI does not open that PR itself. A PR opened with the
  workflow's token runs no CI (GitHub does not trigger workflows from it), so it could
  not merge on green, and the workflow would also need write permissions.

  If a shard stays over the limit after the refresh, raise its `"split"` or make it a
  split shard. `scripts/ci.py plan` shows the predicted parts. One case longer than the
  limit cannot be split: `grail-selfhost` is one case of about 3.5 min.
* **The exercise tree** is checked only for a release tag: the `exercise tree` job of
  `release.yml` generates it with `scripts/mkexercises.py` into a temporary directory
  and builds it (`lake build wiz grail tests`), and the tarball job (which publishes)
  waits for it. Pull requests and master pushes don't build it. It does not run the
  exercise tree's tests (almost all of them fail by design). See
  [exercises.md](exercises.md).
* **The bootstrap fixpoint** (`scripts/fixpoint.sh`: the stage-1 C of the toolchain
  equals its stage-2 C) runs weekly on `master`, or from "Run workflow" with
  `fixpoint` ticked. It takes a long time; run it locally with `nix develop -c
  scripts/fixpoint.sh`.
* **The Nix package** (the `nix package` job): `nix build .#wiz` builds `wiz` and
  `grail` with Lake and nixpkgs' Lean (the flake checks that it is the version in
  `lean-toolchain`), and wraps them with the toolchain as flags (`--cc`, `--cflags`,
  `--ldflags`, `--llc`, `--gc-cflags`, `--gc-ldflags`; flags you pass come later and
  win) and, for `wiz`, the packaged standard library as a module root after `./lib`. CI
  pushes it to the public Cachix cache `badlydrawnwizards` on pushes and on pull
  requests from this repository (which have the token). The tests still use Lake, whose
  artifact cache rebuilds only what changed.
* **The Wiz build caches.** Each test shard keeps what the suite builds from Wiz
  programs between runs: the elaboration cache (`lake test -- --cache ~/.cache/wiz …`),
  `.grail`, and the self-hosted checker and compiler that the tests compile
  (`/tmp/wiz-selfhost-*`). The cache key starts with a hash of everything the compiler
  is made of (the `.lean` files, Lean, `flake.lock`), and partial hits only come from the
  same compiler (the elaboration cache's own keys include the wiz binary's hash, but the
  test driver's grail runs use a fixed binary id and the `/tmp` programs a timestamp).
* **Storage.** The repository's Actions cache holds 10 GB and evicts the least recently
  used entries, so pull requests don't keep big entries: the elan toolchain (~770 MB) is
  saved only by `master` (pull requests restore master's), and a pull request's (or merge
  queue entry's) `lake-*` and `exercises-*` entries (~500 MB each), saved only to hand
  the build to its test shards, are deleted by the `CI result` job when the run ends
  (not when it is cancelled). The next push restores master's build and catches up.
  Artifacts are short-lived: test logs 3 days, `test-timings` 7 days on master (2
  elsewhere), `test-timings-baseline` 7 days, the release tarball 90 days for a tag,
  7 for a snapshot (both are also release assets) and 3 for a pull request.
  To see the usage: `gh api repos/wiz-pl/wiz/actions/cache/usage` and
  `gh cache list -R wiz-pl/wiz -S size_in_bytes`.

* **Path filters.** On a pull request the `changes` job (`scripts/ci.py changes`) reads
  the files the PR changes and decides what runs: nothing but `changes` and `CI result`
  for a docs-only PR (`docs/`, `*.md`, LICENSE); every shard when a Lean file, the build,
  the runtime, `scripts/` or `.github/` changed; otherwise each shard with `"inputs"` in
  `.github/test-shards.json` only when one of its inputs changed (a `lib/X.wiz` input
  brings the lib files it imports), and the shards without `"inputs"` (backends,
  library) for any non-docs change. So a PR touching only, say, `lib/Json.wiz` skips
  `core` and the selfhost shards. `CI result` counts a job the filter skipped as fine
  and a job it wanted only if it succeeded. Pushes to `master`, the merge queue and
  manual runs always run everything, so a missing input shows up there at the latest.
  A test that starts reading a new file belongs in a shard without `"inputs"`, or add
  the file to its shard's `"inputs"`.
* **A self-hosted runner** for the heavy shards (`"heavy": true` in
  `.github/test-shards.json`): set the repository variable `WIZ_RUNNER_HEAVY` to its
  label; unset, everything runs on `ubuntu-latest`. Pull requests from forks never run
  there. Setup, security and aarch64 notes: [ci-runner.md](ci-runner.md).
* **Merging: the merge queue.** CI also runs on `merge_group` events, so `master` can
  have a GitHub merge queue (it needs an organization-owned repository): a queued PR is
  tested merged onto `master` *and the PRs queued ahead of it* (up to 3 entries build at
  once), and lands only if that run's `CI result` passes. Two PRs that are green alone
  but break together (the selfhost/*.wiz case of 2026-11-11) then never both land. To
  queue a green PR: `gh pr merge N -R wiz-pl/wiz --merge --auto` (it enters
  the queue once its own checks pass; `gh pr merge N --disable-auto` takes it out). A
  queue run that fails drops that PR from the queue and rebuilds the ones behind it
  without it. Without a queue (a user-owned repository), `--auto` waits for the required
  check and merges, and "require branches to be up to date" serialises merges instead.

To run Wiz without a checkout or a Lean toolchain, with the binaries from Cachix:

```
nix run --option extra-substituters https://badlydrawnwizards.cachix.org \
  --option extra-trusted-public-keys badlydrawnwizards.cachix.org-1:TxG+RHY8RMC/AXc0LJbYtYm9LW/XRjfQwgz+EEaAjBI= \
  github:wiz-pl/wiz#wiz -- check hello.wiz
```

or `cachix use badlydrawnwizards` once and then `nix run
github:wiz-pl/wiz#wiz -- …` (`#grail` for grail; `wiz build FILE -o OUT`
works out of the box). Without a branch the flake reference means the default branch,
`master`, whose binaries are on Cachix once its `nix package` job has run. The
`--option`s count only for a trusted Nix user (or with the cache in `nix.conf`);
otherwise Nix builds wiz from source, which takes a few minutes.

`#nvim-wiz` is Neovim with the Wiz plugin (editors/nvim, docs/stages/11-tooling.md
11p) and this wiz on `PATH`: `nix run github:wiz-pl/wiz#nvim-wiz --
file.wiz`. `packages.<system>.wiz-nvim` is the plugin alone, for a Neovim
configuration in Nix.
