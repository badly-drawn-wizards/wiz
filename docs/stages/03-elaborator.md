# Stage 3: the elaborator

```
Wiz/
  Elab/Basic.lean        ElabM, metavariables, the local context
  Elab/Unify.lean        force, partial renamings, pattern unification
  Elab/Zonk.lean         replacing solved metavariables before the kernel sees a term
  Elab/Term.lean         bidirectional elaboration of term syntax, implicit arguments
  Elab/Command.lean      def / axiom / #check / #reduce / syntax
  Frontend/Frontend.lean parse a command, elaborate it, repeat
examples/church.wiz      try `lake exe wiz check examples/church.wiz`
```

The elaborator produces *candidate* core terms and the stage 1 kernel re-checks every
declaration. Metavariables are therefore untyped, and quantity errors come from the
kernel. This follows Kovács' elaboration-zoo (`03-holes`, `04-implicit-args`).

Stage 3 changed stage 1 in three small ways (and stage 4 added universe levels): Π types carry a `BinderInfo`
(explicit/implicit), there is a `Term.mvar` / `Head.mvar` the kernel rejects, and the
pretty printer prints surface syntax.

## Optional extensions to stage 3

* **3.10** *Pruning*: solve `?m x y =?= ?n x` by pruning `y` from `?n`. See
  elaboration-zoo `05-pruning`.
* **3.11** Typed metavariables and contextual "could not infer `?A : Type`" messages.
* **3.12** Named arguments `f (A := Nat)`.
* **3.13** Postponement: when a check is stuck on an unsolved meta, such as a lambda
  checked against `?m`, postpone it and retry at the end of the declaration.
* **3.14** Universe level metavariables, so `checkType` always knows the level.
