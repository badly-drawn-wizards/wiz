# Stage 13: the language, for programs this size

Writing the lexer and parser in Wiz showed what the language lacked:

* **Recursion on any argument.** The structural argument is the first one the first
  clause matches; parameters before the colon may be passed unchanged or left out.
* **`partial def` and `mutual … end`.** General recursion: the kernel treats the
  definition as opaque, justified by a witness of its type (22f, so no `False`), and its
  implementation (checked against the type) is what `#eval` and compiled code run. The
  parser's core is a mutual block, with no fuel.
* **Mutual inductive types.** `mutual inductive A … inductive B … end` becomes one
  family indexed by a tag type, `A_B : A_B.Tag → Type`, with `def A := A_B .A`.
  Recursion over a family at a concrete index (`SyntaxF .false`) works.
* **`match` without an expected type**, **tuple patterns** `(a, b, c)`, and `x |> f`.
* Keywords of tactic syntax (`first`, `exact` …) are no longer reserved words.
* The prelude has `Nat.lt` (native at runtime), `Nat.le`, `Nat.max`, `Bool.and/or/not`.

## 13a: named arguments ✅

```
class BitPack (A : Type) where
  width : Nat
def bitWidth (0 A : Type) [BitPack A] : Nat := BitPack.width (A := A)
def sub (a b : Nat) : Nat := Nat.sub a b
#eval sub (b := 1) 5                    -- 4
#eval @BitPack.width (A := Bool) _
```

As in Lean, an argument `(x := e)` fills the parameter named `x`, wherever it is:
implicit, instance or explicit. The other arguments fill the explicit parameters in
order (with `@f`, every parameter), and implicit and instance parameters before a named
one get metavariables and instance problems. A named argument after the last positional
one fills its parameter; an explicit parameter before it with no argument is an error
(Lean would abstract it). Unknown and repeated names are errors (`inferAppNamed`,
`Elab/Term.lean`; test group `elabfix`).

## 13b: private declarations and private constructors ✅

```
private def secret : Nat := 42          -- visible only in this module
structure Shr (ρ : Region) (A : Type) where
  private mk ::                         -- only this module makes a `Shr`
  val : A
```

`private` before a command makes every name it declares (a definition, an axiom, a
structure with its constructor and projections, an inductive type with its
constructors and recursors) private to its **module**: other modules get "'x' is
private to module M"; the module itself, including its later declarations, uses the
names as usual. Privacy is per module ([23c](23-grail.md): each module is elaborated in isolation and
under its own name), and the main file is a module of its own.

`private mk ::` right after a structure's `where` keeps the type and its projections
public but makes the constructor private. Types are structural, so a private name
alone would not stop another module from building a value: a tuple `(5, ())`, or a
structure of its own with the same fields, converts to the type. So outside its module
such a structure is also **opaque** to the elaborator: its definition doesn't unfold
(`Globals.elabView`), it is equal only to itself, and `p.val` reads it through the
projection function `S.val` (`p.1` doesn't work). Within the module nothing changes.
Like Lean's, privacy is enforced by the elaborator: the kernel checks every declaration
against the full environment, where an opaque structure is its Σ again (which is sound:
whatever converts with the definition hidden converts with it unfolded).

The motivating use is `lib/Region.wiz` ([22g](22-numbers.md)): the constructors of the borrow handles
`Shr`, `Uniq`, `Mut` and `Lent` are private, so a handle at a region comes only from a
scope or an operation of the library, and hand-written Wiz can't forge one
(`drafts/rust/rejected/forge_handle.wiz`; test group `regions`). `MutOpt`'s constructors
stay public: their fields are handles already. Not yet: private constructors of an
`inductive` (`| private c …`) and private observations of a `coinductive`. Tests: group
`elabfix`.
