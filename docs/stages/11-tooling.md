# Stage 11: tooling

## 11a–b: queries and a language server ✅

* **Queries** (`Wiz/Query.lean`): elaboration is a pure function of the text, so each
  command's result is memoised under a **content hash chained through every command
  before it**. After an edit, only the commands from the edit on are elaborated again;
  the same text gives the same result (deterministic builds). The elaborator records
  identifiers with their types and ranges, and each global's declaration site, for
  `hoverAt`, `definitionAt` and `completionsAt`.
* **`wiz lsp`** (`Wiz/LSP.lean`): the Language Server Protocol over stdio, with
  diagnostics as you type, hover types, go to definition (also into `lib/`), and
  completion of global names. Each open document has its own query engine.

## 11c: a shared, content-addressed cache ✅

`wiz check`/`build`/`run` keep each command's **effect** (declarations, messages,
registrations, info trees) in the cache directory (`--cache DIR`, default `~/.cache/wiz`;
`--no-cache` turns it off), under the command's chained content hash. A shared directory is a shared cache,
since equal keys mean equal results. Imported modules are cached command by command
too. Commands that change the grammar or the macros rerun (they are cheap).
`Wiz/Cache.lean` serialises terms as S-expressions (quantities through the rig's
literal syntax). Every example gives the same output from the cache as without it.

Next: finer dependencies (re-elaborate only what an edit affects, not everything
after it).

## 11d: the info tree, the infoview and code actions ✅

* **The info tree** (`Elab/Basic.lean`, `Elab/Info.lean`): while elaborating, the
  elaborator records identifiers, the expected type of every checked term (and of every
  hole), the open goals before and after each tactic, `match`es and declarations. It
  keeps values and contexts as it goes (free) and quotes and zonks them at the end of the
  declaration, into `Term`s, not strings. An error carries the state it was thrown in,
  so a declaration that fails (unsolved goals, a hole) still has its tree. The tree is
  memoised and cached with its command; hovers and go to definition read it.
* **The infoview** (`Wiz/Infoview.lean`): `Term.prettyTagged` prints a term exactly as
  `Term.pretty` does, as tagged text: every subterm is a tag whose ref points into the
  document's session table (valid until the next edit). `wiz lsp` answers
  `wiz/plainGoal`, `wiz/plainTermGoal`, `wiz/interactiveGoals`,
  `wiz/interactiveTermGoal` and `wiz/subtermInfo` (a subterm's type, from the kernel,
  and where a constant was declared); the protocol is in
  `wiz-notes/infoview-protocol.md`.
* **Code actions** (`Wiz/Actions.lean`): diagnostics carry a code and data; the server
  offers *did you mean* (edit distance ≤ 2 over locals and globals), *add missing cases*
  (`| .c x y => ?c` per missing constructor) and *add type ascription* to a `def` without
  a type, with edits inline or through `codeAction/resolve`.

```
def k : Nat → Bool → Nat := by
  intro n         -- wiz/plainGoal here:  n : Nat ⊢ Bool → Nat
  intro b
  exact n
def four : Nat := doubel 2    -- unknown identifier 'doubel'   [Did you mean 'double'?]
```

## 11l: the infoview socket ✅

`wiz lsp --infoview SOCK` also listens on the Unix socket `SOCK`, for infoviews that run
beside the editor (the terminal infoview connects there). The editor never says where
its cursor is, so the server infers it from the editor's requests: any request with a
position (hover, `documentHighlight`, which the server now advertises so that editors
send it on every move, go to definition, completion, …) and code actions (at the
range's start). When the cursor moves, and after each elaboration of its document,
every connected infoview gets `wiz/infoview/cursor` (uri, position, session) and pulls
with the ordinary `wiz/*` requests on the socket; sessions and refs are the editor's.
Lean's library has no Unix sockets, so `c/sockets.c` (compiled into the executables by
the linker, `moreLinkObjs` in the lakefile) listens, accepts, and turns a connection
into two ordinary Lean handles. The server's state stays single-threaded: a reader
thread per connection feeds one channel, and one loop answers in order. Protocol §8 of
`wiz-notes/infoview-protocol.md`; tested in-process (the `lsp-server` group: the editor
on a socket pair, an infoview on the socket).

## 11m–n: the infoview, in a terminal and in a browser ✅

```
wiz lsp --infoview /tmp/wiz.sock          # the editor's server (11l)
wiz-infoview /tmp/wiz.sock                # in a tmux split: the goals at the cursor
wiz-infoview --file t.wiz --at 4:5        # or on its own: starts `wiz lsp` itself
web/build.sh && web/bridge.sh             # the same infoview in a browser
```

Both clients are Wiz programs, and they share their logic:

* `lib/Json.wiz`: JSON values (mutual inductive types: Wiz has no nested ones), a
  parser and a printer. Strings are code points; `\uXXXX` escapes and surrogate pairs
  are decoded, and the printer escapes control characters (or everything non-ASCII,
  `Json.renderAscii`).
* `lib/Infoview.wiz`: the protocol's tagged text and goals; a **layout** that flattens
  tagged text into styled pieces (numbering the tags in reading order), word-wraps them
  to a width with hanging indents, and renders lines with SGR colours by kind; the same
  goals as **HTML** with a `data-ref` and `data-idx` on every subterm's `<span>`;
  navigation (next, previous, enclosing, first inside); `Content-Length` framing
  (counting UTF-8 bytes); and the decoding of terminal keys and SGR mouse reports.
* `infoview/Tui.wiz` (`infoview/build.sh`): the terminal program. The alternate screen,
  raw mode, `poll` over the keyboard, the socket and a `SIGWINCH` self-pipe, and Unix
  sockets are `infoview/term.c` (linked by `link_c`, 9f), bound with `extern` (Wiz has no callbacks or
  structs in its FFI, so the event loop is Wiz around a blocking `iv_wait`). ←/→ select
  a subterm, ↑/↓ go out of and into it, and the bottom line says what it is
  (`wiz/subtermInfo`); a mouse click selects too.
* `web/Web.wiz` (`web/build.sh`): the page's language client, compiled to C and then to
  WebAssembly by Emscripten (`wiz --cc emcc`, with `web/js.c` by `link_c`, 9f): wasm64 keeps the runtime's 62-bit small numbers, mini-gmp
  stands in for GMP. It is a library (09-ffi.md, 9g): the page calls its exported
  `wiz_web_step` (state, event → state) on every event, so nothing waits in Wasm. The page
  (`web/infoview.html`, `web/infoview.js`, about 100 lines of JavaScript) only moves events
  in and HTML out. It talks to `wiz lsp --ws PORT` (11o) directly; `web/bridge.sh`
  starts that server and serves the page.

Running it in tmux, next to an editor whose language server is `wiz lsp --infoview
/tmp/wiz.sock` (11l):

```
infoview/build.sh                                   # → .lake/build/bin/wiz-infoview
tmux split-window -h -l 60 '.lake/build/bin/wiz-infoview /tmp/wiz.sock'
```

The pane waits for the server, then follows the editor's cursor. Without an editor:
`wiz-infoview --file examples/tactics.wiz --at 6:3` (`[` and `]` move the line).
`infoview/test.sh` (in the `infoview` test group) runs the terminal infoview against
`infoview/stub_server.py` (canned goals; as text and in a pseudo-terminal) and against
the real `wiz lsp --infoview`, with `infoview/editor_stub.py` as the editor.
`web/test.sh` (needs nix: Emscripten, Chromium; not in CI) runs the Wasm module under
Node (against the stub), then the page in headless Chromium over the DevTools protocol,
against the real `wiz lsp --ws`.

### 11o: the infoview over a WebSocket ✅

A browser can't open a Unix socket, so `wiz lsp --ws PORT` also listens on a WebSocket
(RFC 6455), on `127.0.0.1` only unless an address is given (`--ws ADDR:PORT`; with
`--no-stdio` there is no editor on stdin). `Wiz/WebSocket.lean` is the protocol: the
HTTP upgrade (the answer proves the server understood it: base64 of the SHA-1 of the
client's key and a fixed GUID, both written here), an `Origin` check (any web page may
open a WebSocket to `127.0.0.1`, so only local pages are let in), and frames (a length
in 7, 16 or 64 bits; the client's payload XORed with a mask; fragments; ping and close).
One JSON-RPC message travels per text frame. A WebSocket client is an infoview (it is
told where the cursor is and pulls goals) and may also edit documents of its own, so the
web infoview, which is its own editor, needs no bridge. `c/sockets.c` gained TCP
listen/accept/connect, with connections again as plain Lean handles; the server loop
(`serveWith`) handles messages from every connection in order, as before. Protocol §8.2;
tested in-process (the `lsp-server` group: frames of each length class, the handshake's
RFC example, foreign origins refused, an editor on a socket pair and two pages).

## 11p: a Neovim plugin ✅

`editors/nvim/` is **wiz.nvim**, a Lua plugin for Neovim ≥ 0.10 modelled on lean.nvim
(installation, options, keymaps and the full abbreviation list are in its README):

* **The language server.** The `wiz` filetype (`*.wiz`), a syntax file for highlighting
  (no tree-sitter), and `wiz lsp` started with `vim.lsp.start` for each Wiz buffer, rooted
  at the nearest `grail.wiz`, `wiz-toolchain`, `lakefile.toml` or `.git`. `lsp/wiz.lua` is the same
  configuration for Neovim 0.11's `vim.lsp.enable 'wiz'`. The client asks for
  `wiz/elaborated` (protocol §1), so the infoview hears about every re-elaboration.
* **Unicode input like Lean's.** `\lam` → λ, `\r` → →, `\<` → ⟨, `\-1` → ⁻¹, … from
  Lean's own table (vscode-lean4's `abbreviations.json`, Apache-2.0, vendored) plus Wiz's
  additions: the nine letters Lean leaves free become Greek (`\f` φ, `\h` η, `\j` ξ, `\k`
  κ, `\q` θ, `\s` σ, `\w` ω, `\y` υ, `\z` ζ; Lean's `\l` ←, `\r` →, `\x` × stay), and the
  symbols the repository uses that Lean has no abbreviation for (`\++` ⧺, `\done` ✅,
  `\cross` ✗). An abbreviation is an extmark from the leader to the cursor (so it
  survives edits around it); it is replaced as soon as the next character could not
  continue any abbreviation, when it is complete and nothing longer starts with it, on
  `<Tab>`/`<CR>`, or when insert mode ends. `InsertCharPre` can't edit the buffer, so
  the replacement is scheduled and checks that the text is still there. `:WizAbbrev`
  looks a symbol or an abbreviation up.
* **The infoview.** A split that follows the cursor (debounced) and shows
  `wiz/interactiveGoals` and `wiz/interactiveTermGoal`, sent through the editor's own
  LSP client (no socket: 11l is for infoviews outside the editor). Tagged text becomes
  lines plus a list of tag ranges (kind, ref, nesting depth); kinds get highlight groups
  as extmarks, the innermost tag under the infoview's cursor is highlighted, and `K`
  asks `wiz/subtermInfo` for it (its type and, for a constant, `gd` to its
  declaration). A stale session (`ContentModified`) refreshes the view.
* **Nix.** `packages.<system>.wiz-nvim` (`vimUtils.buildVimPlugin`) and `nix run
  .#nvim-wiz`: Neovim with the plugin and the packaged wiz on `PATH`. The dev shell has
  `neovim`, for the tests.

The `nvim` test group runs `editors/nvim/tests/run.sh`: headless Neovim types
abbreviations through insert mode (and one key at a time in an embedded Neovim, so the
scheduled replacements run between keys and the cursor must end up right), checks that
every non-ASCII character in `lib/*.wiz` has an abbreviation, and drives the infoview
against the real `wiz lsp` on `tests/fixture/Goals.wiz`: the goal after `intro n`, an
argument's expected type, constants highlighted, `K` on `Bool` giving `Bool : Type`,
the view following an edit. It is skipped without `nvim`.

## 11q: go to definition and the infoview for syntax, binders, imports and instances ✅

Hovers, go to definition and the infoview used to know only about terms. Now (as in
Lean) they also know about syntax:

```
syntax (name := twice) "twice" term:max : term       -- declaration of `twice`
macro_rules
  | `(term| twice $x) => `(term| Nat.add $x $x)      -- definition of `twice`
def four : Nat := twice two
--                ^ hover: twice two : Nat
--                         syntax `term.twice` (this file, line 1)
--                         by macro rule (this file, line 3), expands to  Nat.add two two
```

* **Uses of syntax.** Each command the user wrote is walked once for nodes of declared
  kinds (`syntax`, `notation`, `infix…`; also in the patterns of `macro_rules`) and for
  the names of declared categories (`syntax … : c`, `c:prec`, `` `(c| …) ``); the
  elaborator records what expanded each node it met (the macro rule, a procedural macro
  `attribute [macro k] f`, a command macro, or the tactic function `attribute [tactic k]
  f`) and what it expanded to. **Go to definition** goes to what expanded it, **go to
  declaration** (`textDocument/declaration`, now advertised) to the `syntax` command;
  for `notation` and `infix…` both are the same command. Prelude notation (`+`, `do`,
  …) jumps into the toolchain's `lib/Prelude.wiz`. The hover shows the source with its
  type, the syntax and where it was declared, the rule and the expansion (one step), and
  the instance the notation needed (`Add Nat`). The declaring commands' ranges are kept
  by kind and category (`CommandState.kindSites`, `catSites`) and in each `MacroRule`.
* **Macro output is synthetic.** A template's ranges are those of the file that
  declared the rule, so before this an expansion of a Prelude macro recorded hovers and
  expected types at Prelude offsets in the user's file. `SourceInfo.synthetic` now marks
  a template's nodes (and a procedural macro's output, which has the call's range):
  nothing is recorded at them, and the local context keeps the nearest range the user
  wrote, so errors inside an expansion point at the macro call or at the argument the
  user wrote. What antiquotations bind keeps its ranges, so `twice two` still has a
  hover on `two`.
* **Binders and pattern variables** (of `def`, `fun`, `∀`/`→`, `×`, `let`, inductive
  and structure parameters and fields, and `match` arms) are recorded like identifiers
  (hover: `n : Nat`) and with their context, so the expected type request
  (`wiz/plainTermGoal`, the infoview's "Expected type") shows a pattern variable in the
  context of its arm.
* **`import M`**: hover shows the module's file, go to definition opens it.
* **Commands, instances and messages: `wiz/interactiveInfo`**, a new infoview request
  (protocol in `wiz-notes/infoview-protocol.md`, §4), lists what else is at the cursor:
  the syntax and expansion, the import, the instances found at the innermost
  application (`instance … : Mul Nat`, at `2 * 3`), the declarations of the command
  (a `structure`: its type, constructor and fields, with their types; an `inductive`:
  its constructors), and the messages there (`#check`, `#eval`). wiz.nvim shows them as
  sections under the goals, and `gd` on an item jumps to it. `#check`, `#eval`,
  `#reduce`, `#run`, `inductive` and `structure` now keep their info trees, so hovers
  work inside them too.

Not covered: hovers inside tactic arguments (a tactic gets its syntax without ranges),
a procedural macro's output (it has no ranges of the user's), the arguments of
`attribute`, and docstrings (Wiz has none). Design notes: `wiz-notes/info-syntax.md`.
Tested in the `lsp-server` group and by wiz.nvim's tests (`nvim`).

## 11r: printing notation (unexpanders) ✅

Terms print as the notation they were written with: `#check`, `#reduce`, `#eval`,
messages (`type mismatch`, kernel errors), hovers and the infoview's goals.

```
#check fun (n : Nat) => n + 1        -- fun n => n + 1 : Nat → Nat
#check [1, 2, 3]                     -- [1, 2, 3] : List Nat
#check fun (b c : Bool) => b && !c   -- fun b c => b && !c : Bool → Bool → Bool
#check ∃ (n : Nat), n = n            -- ∃ n, n = n : Prop
```

Before, these printed the elaborated term: `Add.add Nat instAddNat n 1`,
`List.cons Nat 1 (List.cons Nat 2 (List.cons Nat 3 (List.nil Nat)))`, and a `match` on a
`Bool.casesOn`. The mechanism is Lean's: a delaborator and `app_unexpander`s
(`Core/Pretty.lean`, `Syntax/PPTable.lean`).

* **Unexpanders.** At an application of a constant `c`, its explicit arguments (the
  binder infos of `c`'s type say which) are turned into syntax, bottom-up, and `c`'s
  unexpanders are tried, latest first, on `c x₁ … xₙ` as syntax; the first that applies
  gives the notation (arguments beyond what it takes are applied to it). A subterm that
  isn't notation (or a variable, a constant, a numeral, a `fun`) stays a leaf, printed
  as before.
* **Three kinds.** (1) *Automatic*: every `notation`, `infixl`/`infixr`/`infix` and
  `macro_rules` rule whose template is a constant applied to the rule's variables is
  read backwards (`+ - * / %`, `++`, `!`, `-x`, `|>`, `∧ ∨ ¬ ↔`, `<$>`, user notation).
  So the notation declared last for a constant is the one printed (Logic declares its
  ASCII spellings `/\`, `\/`, `<->` first). (2) *Declared*:
  `app_unexpander c | `(term| $f $x …) => `(term| …)`, quotation rules over the
  application (`$f` is the head); the Prelude prints `Bool.casesOn` as `if`/`&&`/`||`
  this way, Logic `Ex (fun x => p)` as `∃ x, p`. (3) *Procedural*:
  `attribute [app_unexpander c] f` with `f : Macro` (`Syntax → MacroM Syntax`, failing
  when it doesn't apply), run by the interpreter: the Prelude's `ListLit.unexpandNil`
  and `ListLit.unexpandCons` print `List.nil` as `[]` and `List.cons x [ys,*]` as
  `[x, ys,*]`, collecting the spine from the last cell up. All three can be `local`; a
  module's local ones (and its local notation's automatic ones) end with it.
* **`match`.** A `match` elaborates to `(fun x => T.casesOn … x : …) scrutinee`; such a
  redex prints as its reduct when that has an unexpander, so `if` comes back.
* **Formatting.** The notation is printed by walking the grammar of each node's kind
  (the parser descriptors, built-in ones included): atoms, children at the precedence
  their position asks for, parentheses where a node's precedence is lower (a node whose
  grammar ends in an open `term p`, like `fun` or `if`, counts as precedence `p`).
  Spacing follows the atoms as declared (`" + "`, `"!"`, `"∃ "`); keywords get spaces,
  brackets none, separators `, `. A node that can't be formatted (a kind without a
  grammar, a shape the grammar doesn't fit) prints its subterm without notation, so an
  unexpander can make output prettier but never wrong.
* **Tags survive.** Every syntax node made from a subterm remembers it, so in the
  infoview the subterms of notation (`n`, `1` and the whole `n + 1`) are still tagged
  and hoverable. (A procedural unexpander's output keeps the tags of its leaves only.)
* **Options.** `wiz … --pp-all` prints without notation (and turns the cache off);
  `set_option pp.notation false` (or `pp.all true`) does so from that point of a file
  (a module's setting stays in the module). `Term.prettyPrec` (used where printed terms
  are parsed back, `Reflect.lean`) never uses notation.

Not covered (follow-ups): implicit arguments outside notation still print (Lean hides
them: `pp.explicit false`), data values from `#eval`/`#reduce` (`.cons 1 .nil`) are
constructor values, not applications, so lists print as before there; `do` notation;
`⟨a, b⟩` and structure literals; numerals of other types (`OfNat.ofNat`); goals passed
to tactics as text and `trace_state` print without notation. The self-hosted toolchain
has its own printer (selfhost/Frontend.wiz) and prints no notation. Design notes:
`wiz-notes/pp-unexpand.md`. Tested in the `language` group.

## 11s: scroll, the documentation generator (`wiz doc`) ✅

Like Lean's doc-gen4: a static site from a set of modules. Design notes:
`wiz-notes/scroll.md`.

    wiz doc [MODULE|FILE|DIR …] -o OUT [--lib] [--source-url URL] [--title T] [--web DIR]
    grail doc [TARGET…] [-o OUT] [--source-url URL] [--title T]

`--lib` documents the toolchain's library; a directory, every module under it (it is a
module root too); a file or module name, that module. `grail doc` runs `wiz doc` on the
package's `lib` targets with its module roots (dependencies included), into
`.grail/doc`. Source links are `URL` + the file's path in its root + `#L<line>`
(without `--source-url`, the path as text). Flags only, no environment variables.

* **Doc comments.** `/-- … -/` right before a command (only whitespace between)
  documents the declarations it makes, as in Lean; before a constructor (`/-- … -/ | c`
  or `| /-- … -/ c`) or a `structure`/`class` field, that one. `/-! … -/` documents the
  module (without one, scroll takes the module's leading `--` comment block). To the
  lexer a doc comment is still a block comment: the grammar is unchanged, and the
  self-hosted frontend (selfhost/Lex.wiz) deliberately ignores doc comments (they are
  for tools; nothing it checks depends on them). The Lean frontend finds a command's doc
  comment from where the command starts (`docCommentBefore`,
  `Wiz/Parser/DocComment.lean`) and stores it with what the declaration is:
  `CommandState.declDocs : Name → DeclDoc` (`kind`: `def`, `partial def`, `inductive`,
  `structure`, `class`, `instance`, `constructor`, `field`, `auxiliary`, …; `doc`;
  `parent`), `CommandState.docOf?`. The cache replays them (`Effect.docs`; salt 15).
  Doc comments are Markdown (`Wiz/Doc/Markdown.lean`: paragraphs, headings, fences,
  lists, quotes, `code`, emphasis, links; HTML is escaped), and a name in backticks links
  to its declaration.
* **The site** (`Wiz/Doc/Site.lean`): `index.html` (the modules and their summaries),
  one page per module (`A.B.html`): every public declaration (private and auxiliary ones
  are left out) with its kind, its signature (the infoview's tagged printer,
  `Term.prettyTagged`, so notation-aware printing applies when it does), its doc, a
  source link, its constructors or fields, and the instances of a class or for a type;
  every constant in a signature links to where it is documented (the definition sites
  the language server's go to definition uses, `declSites`). `search.js` is the
  client-side index of every declaration (name, module, kind, summary), searched by
  `scroll-search.js` (`/` focuses the box). The pages are complete HTML: they read
  without JS, and the search works from `file://`.
* **Interactive signatures, with the infoview's Wasm.** Each page carries its data as
  JSON (`<script id="wiz-doc-data">`, and `A.B.json`): per declaration the signature in
  the infoview protocol's tagged-text format and the table of its subterms, each a
  `wiz/subtermInfo` answer (`kind`, `name`, `text`, `type`, `definition` as a link),
  precomputed since there is no server. With the Wasm module (served over HTTP), the
  web infoview's module (`web/Web.wiz`, now also exporting `wiz_doc_init` and
  `wiz_doc_step`) renders each signature as it comes into view: hover a subterm for its
  type and where it is defined, click a constant to go to its definition, click anything
  else to select it (the arrows move the selection, as in the infoview). The tagged text
  both share is a library of its own, `lib/Tagged.wiz` (the JSON, flattening, numbering
  and navigating tags, the HTML, the subterm box `Tagged.infoHtml`, and the page's
  model `DocPage.step`), which `lib/Infoview.wiz` imports; the browser half they share is
  `web/tagged.js` (loading and stepping the module, the mouse and keys on `.tt`), used by
  `web/infoview.js` and `web/scroll.js`. `web/build.sh` builds the module as before and
  copies the site's scripts and `scroll.css`; `wiz doc` takes them from `share/wiz/web`
  of a release, `web/out` of a checkout, or `--web DIR`. Without them the pages are
  plain HTML (and `wiz doc` says so).
* **CI** builds the library's documentation on `master` with the Wasm module (the
  `docs` job, on pushes only: `wiz doc --lib` with source links to the commit) and
  uploads it as the artifact `wiz-docs` (kept 3 days). Proposed, not configured: publish it from `master` to GitHub Pages
  (`actions/upload-pages-artifact` + `actions/deploy-pages` in that job, Pages set to
  "GitHub Actions").
* **Tests**: the group `doc` (`Tests/Doc.lean`): doc comments stored and replayed by the
  cache; Markdown; `wiz doc` on a small package with doc comments (kinds, docs, source
  links, instances, the index); every cross-link resolves; every declaration is in the
  search index; the pages without JS; `grail doc`; and the page model of the Wasm module
  run natively on a page's JSON (hover, click, keys).

## 11w: hovers in tactic arguments, the other infoviews, `local instance`, the browser infoview ✅

* **Ranges through reflected syntax.** A tactic or procedural macro gets the user's
  syntax as a Wiz `Syntax` value, which has no ranges, and its output used to get the
  call's range everywhere. Now `encodeSyntax` adds each node's range as two hidden
  trailing fields of its constructor value. Wiz code never reads them (`SyntaxF` has no
  such fields), so they survive exactly when a tactic hands back the value it was given
  (`exact $t` passes `t` through), and are absent from anything it builds;
  `relocate` (after the exercise `decodeSyntax`) puts them back, and everything else is
  synthetic (11q). So hovers, expected types and go to definition work inside `by`
  arguments, nested tactics (`first`, `repeat`, `( … ; … )`) record their goals at
  their own ranges, and a list literal's elements keep theirs.
* **The terminal and web infoviews** ask for `wiz/interactiveInfo` too and show its
  sections (Syntax, Import, Instances, Declarations, Messages) under the goals, with the
  same tags (`lib/Infoview.wiz`: `InfoItem`, `View.ofInfo`, `Infoview.htmlInfo`).
* **`local instance`** (13m's `local` for instances, as Lean has it): the instance is
  found in its module only; the importer doesn't see it (its definition, a name, stays).
* **The infoview in a browser from wiz.nvim**: `:WizInfoviewBrowser` (`<LocalLeader>b`)
  sends `wiz/browserInfoview` to the buffer's own server, which starts listening on a
  WebSocket (127.0.0.1, a free port) unless it already does, and answers with the page's
  URL; Neovim opens it (`vim.ui.open`). The same port serves the web infoview's four
  files over HTTP (`WebSocket.webAssets`: only those names, and only to local origins;
  anything else is `404`/`403`), from `share/wiz/web` of a release toolchain (the release
  job builds them with Emscripten) or `web/out` of a checkout (`web/build.sh`), or
  `wiz lsp --web DIR`. With `?follow=1` the page has no editor of its own: it follows
  the editor's cursor (`wiz/infoview/cursor`, §8.2). `wiz lsp` now always runs the
  multi-connection loop (`serveWith`), so this works without `--ws`.
