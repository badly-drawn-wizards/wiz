# The M0 obligations, as `Prop`s

The design note (`/workspace/wiz-notes/stc-m0-spec.md` §5) asks F0 to **state** what its
metatheory will prove, not to prove it yet. This file is that list:

* `SoundF0 sg`: a checker exists that is sound, complete and total for F0 typing;
* `Con sg`: an axiom-free signature has no closed term of type `Empty prop`;
* `WHN sg`: a deterministic, typed weak-head strategy reaches a whnf at every relevant
  type (a proposition is excluded: `WhRed` is empty there);
* `DecConv sg`: conversion is decided by a sound and complete whnf-interleaved algorithm;
* `DecTC sg`: typing is decided by a sound and complete bidirectional algorithm.

The checker shape is `WizMeta/Checker.lean`'s: fuel-indexed, substitution-based, `M` a
result or a fuel/error. The functions themselves are M1 work; nothing here is proved.

The last section adds the statements the sorting lemma (`SortUniqueAt`, `F0/WhRed.lean`)
reduces to: uniqueness of types up to conversion (`TyUnique`) and injectivity of the type
formers at conversion (`ConvInjPi`, `ConvInjSigma`, `ConvInjEq`, `ConvInjEqTy`,
`ConvInjEnum`, `ConvInjSort`). `F0/Sorting.lean` proves the reduction and records which
rule-level cases block the statements themselves.

The route is PT23's set model of codes plus the Σ/Unit/Enum/ULift cases of the model memo;
no mechanised model in M0. `castRefl` is not a rule, so consistency is relative to a
signature that does not declare it. -/

needs the sorting lemma `SortUniqueAt` (`F0/WhRed.lean`); see the note there. -/

/-! ## The sorting lemma's supporting statements

`SortUniqueAt` (`F0/WhRed.lean`) says a term has at most one sort. Its proof is
"regularity plus uniqueness of types plus injectivity of the formers" (`stc-plan.md`,
M1). The two statements below are that obligation, split at the joint the rules make
visible; `F0/Sorting.lean` derives `SortUniqueAt` from them, and proves the parts of them
that F0's rules do give. They are *statements to prove in M1*: the declarative rules have
no inversion principle for `≡` and no normal-form theorem. Two of the rule-level gaps the
first version of this note recorded are now rules (`Spec/Struct.lean`: `eqTyped`,
`ctxConv`), so `Sorting.lean`'s `conv`/`cong` blockers are discharged; the `trans` case is
not (it needs `ConvJoin`, `Sorting.lean`), and `TyUnique` as stated has a top-universe
boundary (`Sort u1` is not a term with a sort), for which `Sorting.lean` states the
corrected `TyUniqueTyped` and `TopSortUnique`. -/

/-- **`TyUnique`**: two types of one term are convertible at one sort. This is
"uniqueness of types up to conversion"; its proof is where the injectivity lemmas
(`ConvInjPi`, …) are used, at the `conv` case, and those lemmas in turn are where `trans`
and `irrel` block (`F0/Sorting.lean`, "the gap"). -/
def TyUnique (sg : Sig) : Prop :=
  ∀ Γ t A B, Derivable (F0 sg) (Γ ⊢ t ∶ A) → Derivable (F0 sg) (Γ ⊢ t ∶ B) →
    ∃ s, Derivable (F0 sg) (Γ ⊢ A ≡ B ∶ .sort s)

/-- **`ConvInjSort`**: two convertible sorts are the same sort. This is what the `irrel`
case of `SortUniqueAt` needs: proof irrelevance must not identify a sort with anything. -/
def ConvInjSort (sg : Sig) : Prop :=
  ∀ Γ u v C, Derivable (F0 sg) (Γ ⊢ .sort u ≡ .sort v ∶ C) → u = v

/-- **Injectivity of `Π`** at conversion: a convertible pair of `Π` types has convertible
domains and codomains (the codomains under the binder). Together with the `Σ`, `Eq`,
`EqTy` and `Enum` versions this is `stc-plan.md`'s "injectivity of Π, Σ, Eq/EqTy, Enum";
it is what the `conv` case of `TyUnique` needs at an application. -/
def ConvInjPi (sg : Sig) : Prop :=
  ∀ Γ s₁ A₁ B₁ s₂ A₂ B₂ C, Derivable (F0 sg) (Γ ⊢ .pi s₁ A₁ B₁ ≡ .pi s₂ A₂ B₂ ∶ C) →

/-- **Injectivity of `Σ`** at conversion. -/
def ConvInjSigma (sg : Sig) : Prop :=
  ∀ Γ s₁ A₁ B₁ s₂ A₂ B₂ C,

    (∃ i, Derivable (F0 sg) (Γ ⊢ A₁ ≡ A₂ ∶ .sort i)) ∧
    (∃ j, Derivable (F0 sg) ((A₁ :: Γ) ⊢ B₁ ≡ B₂ ∶ .sort j))

/-- **Injectivity of `Eq`** at conversion: the index type and the two endpoints agree. -/
def ConvInjEq (sg : Sig) : Prop :=
  ∀ Γ A a b A' a' b' C, Derivable (F0 sg) (Γ ⊢ .eq A a b ≡ .eq A' a' b' ∶ C) →

    Derivable (F0 sg) (Γ ⊢ a ≡ a' ∶ A) ∧ Derivable (F0 sg) (Γ ⊢ b ≡ b' ∶ A)

def ConvInjEqTy (sg : Sig) : Prop :=
  ∀ Γ A B A' B' C, Derivable (F0 sg) (Γ ⊢ .eqTy A B ≡ .eqTy A' B' ∶ C) →

    (∃ s', Derivable (F0 sg) (Γ ⊢ B ≡ B' ∶ .sort s'))

/-- **Injectivity of `Enum`** at conversion: the sizes agree (an enumeration is its size). -/
def ConvInjEnum (sg : Sig) : Prop :=
  ∀ Γ n m C, Derivable (F0 sg) (Γ ⊢ .enum n ≡ .enum m ∶ C) → n = m

/-- A bidirectional typing checker: `tc fuel Γ t A` decides `Γ ⊢ t ⇐ A`. -/
abbrev TCChecker := Nat → Ctx → Tm → Tm → M Bool

/-- **`DecTC`**: bidirectional typing is sound and complete, hence decidable. -/
def DecTC (sg : Sig) : Prop :=
  ∃ tc : TCChecker,
    (∀ n Γ t A, tc n Γ t A = .ok true → Derivable (F0 sg) (Γ ⊢ t ∶ A)) ∧
    (∀ n Γ t A, tc n Γ t A = .ok false → ¬ Derivable (F0 sg) (Γ ⊢ t ∶ A)) ∧
