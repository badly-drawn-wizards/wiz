# `WhRed` is empty at propositions

`WHN` (`Obligations.lean`) is stated only at a type `A` whose sort is not `prop`, the
side condition that lets the strategy leave proofs alone. Its justification is that
`WhRed` (`Spec/Fragments.lean`) --- a reduction of a *relevant* term --- has no instance
at a proposition:

    WhRed T Γ t u A = Derivable T (Γ ⊢ t ⟶ u ∶ A) ∧ ∃ s, Derivable T (Γ ⊢ A ∶ .sort s) ∧ s.NeverZero.

The second conjunct is what fails: `WhRed` carries a nonzero sort of `A`, while a
proposition is typed at `prop`. Making the two sorts equal is a **sorting lemma**
(`SortUniqueAt` below): every term has at most one sort. It is a consequence of
regularity plus uniqueness of types; `stc-plan.md` lists uniqueness of types as an M1
consequence, and M0 has no inversion/regularity lemma, so it is not derivable from the
rules as given here without that development. The theorem below therefore takes it as an
explicit hypothesis, which is exactly the missing statement; the reduction judgment in
`WhRed`'s first conjunct plays no role in the emptiness (there *are* reductions at
propositions, e.g. `Pi.beta` into a `Π` ending in `Prop`; they are just not `WhRed`).
