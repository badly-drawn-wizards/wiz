# Judgments, and rules as data

The architecture is `WizMeta/Spec/Rule.lean`'s, reduced to the four judgments F0 needs
(`/workspace/wiz-notes/stc-m0-spec.md` §2):

    ⊢ Γ                    the context is well formed
    Γ ⊢ t ∶ A              typing (types are terms: `Γ ⊢ A ∶ Sort s`)
    Γ ⊢ t ≡ u ∶ A          conversion
    Γ ⊢ t ⟶ u ∶ A          one step of weak-head reduction

`inert`, `inertD` and `peq` vanish with T1/T2: F0 has no regularity and no descriptions.

A **rule** is a list of premises and a conclusion; each former's file defines the set of
its rule instances (a non-recursive inductive predicate on `Rule`, one constructor per
rule, side conditions as hypotheses); a **system** is a union of such sets; `Derivable R j`
is the one inductive definition.

Reduction is a judgment of its own so that the rule a checker implements by a contraction
is told apart from one it implements in conversion (η, irrelevance). Every reduction is a
conversion (`Core.redEq`). **Proofs are never reduced**: at a proposition conversion holds
by irrelevance and needs no reduction (see `WhRed` in `Spec/Fragments.lean`).
