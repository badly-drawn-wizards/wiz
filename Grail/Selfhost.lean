# The self-hosted toolchain as targets (stage 23e)

`selfhost NAME ROLE` targets build the self-hosted programs from `selfhost/*.wiz`:

* `checker`: the self-hosted frontend (reads `input.wiz`, prints what it makes of it);
* `compiler`: the frontend and backend (reads `input.wiz`, prints C);
* `bootstrap`: the fixpoint check of `scripts/fixpoint.sh`. Stage 1 (the compiler, built
  by the Lean `wiz`) compiles the toolchain to C (`self1.c`); that C, compiled with
  `selfhost/rt.c` and the collector, is stage 2, which compiles the toolchain again
  (`self2.c`). The two must be equal.

Each step is a job (`Grail/Graph.lean`): the generated source (keyed by the
`selfhost/*.wiz` texts and this binary, which holds the parser tables; installed as
`.grail/gen/ROLE.wiz`), then the executable as for any `exe`, then
`self1.c` (keyed by the stage-1 binary and its input), stage 2 (by `self1.c`, `rt.c`,
the compiler and the collector's flags) and `self2.c`. Run again, the check runs nothing
unless something it depends on changed.
