# Erasure

Stage 5 starts compilation. A kernel-checked term is turned into an **untyped**
program (`ETerm`) by erasing everything with no runtime content:

* types (anything whose type is a `Sort`), proofs (anything whose type is a `Prop`),
  sizes, quantities, and universe levels all become `◾` (`ETerm.erased`);
* arguments to, and `let`s of, quantity `0` become `◾`. QTT guarantees an erased
  variable is never needed at runtime, so this is the payoff of stage 1.

Binders are kept (an erased argument is passed as `◾`), so de Bruijn indices don't
change. A later pass can drop them.

**Data representation.** The payload of a value of `μ D i` is nested pairs
`(tag, f₁, …, fₙ, e, ())`. At runtime it is **flat**: one object `⟨tag f₁ … fₙ⟩`, with
the constructor's tag as the object's tag (or `⟨0 f₁ … fₙ⟩` if the description doesn't
start with a choice of tag), and `◾` in the places of erased fields. Numbers of the
registered `nat` type stay numbers. A constructor applied to its fields becomes the
object directly; case analysis reads the fields directly (`resolveViews`). Code that
handles payloads generically (`ind` with hypotheses) converts with the primitives
`pack` and `unpack`, which walk the description.

The generic eliminators (`ind`, `Desc.elim`, the `map` behind coiteration) become
runtime **primitives** that walk the description, which is itself an ordinary runtime
value. A description whose first argument is a tag, `Desc.arg (Enum ls) F`, is marked:
`⟨4 ◾ F⟩` instead of `⟨1 ◾ F⟩`, so that `pack` knows to use the tag. For a number,
`ind` and the conversions get the description wrapped as `⟨5 D⟩`.

Erasure is **type-directed**, so it is bidirectional like the kernel: `eraseCheck`
knows the expected type, `eraseInfer` computes it with the kernel's `infer`.

stage 22d): compiled code builds its values with `mk` (which has the constructor's type)
and reads its one runtime field with `get`, so the value itself can be anything the
natives agree on (a machine word, an array). The model's object would be
`⟨tag f₀ … fₙ₋₁⟩` with every field but `r` erased; the constructor's argument `p` is that
field. -/

building it is the identity, `.1` is the identity, `.2` is `◾`. A one-field structure
(`Shr ρ A`, a newtype) is then its field, and an `n`-field one is `n - 1` pairs instead
of `n`.

The decision is a function of the Σ type alone, with its second component taken at a
**variable** (never at the pair's actual first component: building, projecting and
reading back must agree), and by shape, so that two convertible types get one
representation (R3). But it is **not stable under substitution**: generic code over
`A × B` sees a neutral `B` and keeps the pair, and `B` can be instantiated with a
structure's tail (`first (S.mk 5)` with `first : A × B → A`), so the caller's value and
the callee's code disagree. No test on the second component can be stable, hence the

erased field), so nothing here may be taken as a second check of the term.)

again: along an elimination spine only (heads, applications, projections, annotations,

Redexes `(λ x. b) a` become `let x := a; b`. Case analysis gets a value's payload as `view D x`. Its projections are resolved
against the flat object: with `x` bound to `y`, the payload's `.0` is the tag of `y`
(`prim .tag`, or a `case` on `y` itself), and `.1.….1.0` (`j` times `.1`) is field
`j - 1`. Without a tag in front (`absorbed = false`) it is field `j`; for a number, the
tag and field are `natTag` and `natPred`. A view used any other way is converted with
`unpack`. -/

value at level `y`; `D` is the description, valid at level `dLvl`. -/
