# Direct calls out of reverted arguments (compiled equations)

A structurally recursive definition's compiled equations (`Decl.impl`, derived from its
value by `deriveImpl` in `Elab/Command.lean`) are its value with each induction hypothesis
replaced by the direct call it stands for. The kernel checks that they agree with the
value, one conversion per constructor (`checkImplAgrees`). A nested split reverts the
hypotheses (their types mention the field it splits), so in the derived term a call can
be an argument of an inner `casesOn`, and compiled code would compute it before the case,
whether the branch taken uses it or not. `pushCalls` moves such arguments into the
branches of the inner split, before erasure (`eraseDecl`): a rewrite of the compiler's,
like erasure, done on the checked term and checked again (the result must have the
declared type, or the unrewritten term is compiled). In branch `c` the call is on
`c fields` where its type needs the scrutinee, otherwise on the scrutinee itself.
