# `native_refl`: deciding a closed equation by running it (stage 27a)

`def X : a = b := native_refl` (with `--trust-native`) is accepted when running `a` and
`b` gives the same value. The command elaborator calls `decideNative`, then adds the
axiom `X.native✝ : a = b` and `X := X.native✝` (`Command.lean`).

1. Erase `a` and `b` and the definitions they reach (`compileReachableE`, as `#eval`
   does, with foreign functions' models), and refuse if a definition can't be erased or
   is a partial definition (its implementation is unchecked and may diverge).
2. Run both (`NativeRun`: `#eval`'s interpreter with fuel and errors instead of panics).
3. Read each result back **strictly** as a closed term of `T` (`nativeReadback`): only
   first-order data is accepted, and anything that is not a value of `T`'s shape is an
   error (not a default).
4. The kernel checks each read-back term against `T` and decides `conv` between them
   (two normal forms of first-order data: cheap).

What it trusts: see `wiz-notes/native-refl.md` and docs/Status.md ("Trusted base").
