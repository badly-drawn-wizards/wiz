# scry's Datalog engine (S3, deep embedding)

The group `scry-datalog` checks `lib/Scry/Store.wiz`, `lib/Scry/Datalog.wiz` and
`lib/Scry/Eval.wiz` through `examples/scry-datalog-*.wiz`; the group `scry-egraph`
checks the S12 e-graph (`lib/Scry/Egraph.wiz`) through `examples/scry-egraph-*.wiz`.
The Datalog group's cases are:

* transitive closure and a provenance witness;
* same-generation;
* a lattice-valued relation (a product of a min and a max lattice);
* constant propagation with a conflict joining to `top`;
* stratified negation, and the same file's non-stratified program rejected;
* the pure list model of the relation store.

The engine is ordinary Wiz, so the same examples run under the interpreter (`#eval`) and
compiled (C and LLVM); the transitive-closure case runs both. The design is in
`wiz-notes/scry-datalog.md`.
