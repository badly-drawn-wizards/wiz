# Kernel lint: every traversal handles every constructor, and every child of it

Two soundness bugs had the same shape: a traversal with a default case that silently
skipped a constructor (`Term.mapChildrenM` had no case for `natOp`: audit S1, a closed
proof of `False`). This group makes that a test failure. See `wiz-notes/kernel-lint.md`.

How it works.

* **The constructor lists are read from the source** (`Wiz/Core/Term.lean`, `Value.lean`,
  `Level.lean`, `selfhost/Kernel.wiz`): `parseInductive`. Nothing here lists them by hand.
* **Each constructor has a witness builder** in a table below (`termTable`, `valTable`, …):
  a function from "the children" to a value of that constructor. The tables are checked
  against the source: a constructor without a row, a row whose number of children differs
  from the fields in the source, or a field of a type the lint does not know, fails. So a
  new constructor, or a new field, fails the lint until its row is written.
* **The properties** put a *mark* (a variable, a level parameter) in one child at a time and
  require each traversal to find, rename or instantiate it. That catches a skipped child of
  a handled constructor, not only a missing case.
* `Kernel.wiz` is checked statically: its traversals are parsed, and each must have an arm
  for every constructor that has children, with every child used on the right-hand side
  (`wizFns`). The exceptions are listed with their reasons.
* The catch-all arms (`| _ =>`) of the Lean kernel's traversals are counted and pinned
  (`pinned`): a new one fails until it is reviewed (and the note's table updated).

**Adding a constructor** (`Term`, `Val`, `Head`, `Elim`, `Level`, or `Kernel.wiz`'s): add
its row to the table here; the failures that remain name the traversals that skip it.

  answer, so a constructor may be left to it;
* otherwise every constructor that has a child must have its own arm;
* in every arm, each child (a field whose type is in `childTys`) is bound to a variable
  that the right-hand side uses, unless `(constructor, field)` is in `exempt`.

Each ill-typed term below makes one eliminator of the evaluator panic. The checker never
evaluates a term it has not checked. The one exception this audit found, the display hint
of a `mu`/`nu` (`wiz-notes/kernel-lint.md`, H), is closed by `checkHint` (PR #83):
`hintCarrier X` carries the raw term `X` in a hint, and `addDecl` now rejects it with an
ordinary error before evaluating it. The panics themselves are reached by evaluating each
term directly (`--panic-probe MODE eval:SITE`). -/
