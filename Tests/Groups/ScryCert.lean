# scry's derivation certificates (S8)

The group `scry-cert` checks `lib/Scry/Cert.wiz` through
`examples/scry-derivation.wiz`:

* a valid transitive-closure derivation is accepted, rendered and explained from the
  evaluator's provenance;
* a wrong premise, an out-of-range rule and a falsified EDB fact are rejected;
* a lattice-valued fact certified by a join of rule instances (the min lattice) is
  accepted, and a wrong join is rejected;
* the same example compiled to C and LLVM.

The checker, its shape and the soundness theorem are in `wiz-notes/scry-derivation.md`.
