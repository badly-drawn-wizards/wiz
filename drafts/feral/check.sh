#   sh drafts/feral/check.sh
# * the runtime stand-ins and every hand-lowered program check;
# * every surface program (lib/Feral.wiz lowers it) checks;
# * every program of rejected/surface is rejected by the front end, and every hand-written
#   lowering in rejected/ by the kernel (a type error, or a private constructor).
# The test group `feral` (lake test -- '=feral') checks more: results against the
# hand-lowered programs, error classes and lines, and the kernel's verdict on the
# `#unchecked` lowering of each rejected program.
