# Feral drafts: what checks, what doesn't, and why

Branches `agent/rust-drafts`, `agent/rust-regions` (regions). Check everything that
should check, and that the rejected programs fail, with `sh drafts/feral/check.sh` (from
the worktree root, after `lake build`); the libraries' tests are `lake test -- optic`
and `lake test -- regions`.

## The front end (22j, branch agent/feral-surface)

`lib/Feral.wiz` (about 2400 lines of Wiz) implements `feral … end` for the fragment of
LOWERING.md §1a. Test group `feral`: the twelve `surface/` programs lower, check and
evaluate like `lowered/`; the nine `rejected/surface/` programs are rejected by the front
end (error class and line) and by the kernel on their `#unchecked` lowering.

What Feral is and isn't: Feral is Rust's ownership discipline for a small first-order
language, explained by translation — a Feral program *is* the Wiz program `#lower` shows,
and the borrow errors are that program's type errors, reported early and in Rust's terms
by a front-end checker with the same region-carrying types. It is not a borrow checker
in the kernel: aliasing (one live `&mut`, no use of a lender while it is lent) is enforced
by the *shape* of the lowering — every borrow is a scope that rebinds the lender's name to
a `Lent` token, and the front end never emits a handle twice — not by linearity. Handles
are ordinary ω values, so hand-written Wiz against lib/Region.wiz can duplicate one (the
KNOWN GAP cases of `regions` and `feral`). The surface never mentions handles, scopes,
tokens or handed-back tuples, and the generated code already destructures (never
projects) tuples that carry a handle and uses each handle once; when handles become
linear (/workspace/wiz-notes/linear-case-design.md, stage 2; D8: error alternatives must
hand the handle back) what changes is the text emitted for scopes and for `match` on
`Result` (L5, L20) and the types of lib/Region.wiz's scopes, not the grammar or the
checker's rules.

Not in the fragment (each is an error "not supported yet", never a silent miscompile):
inline spec clauses on `fn` (use a `spec f requires (P) ensures (Q)` item), loop invariants, `loop`/`break`/`continue`, `impl`/`trait`, closures, struct literals with
fields, assignment to `x.f`/`v[i]`, `while let` directly through a `&mut` (use a cursor),
more than two lenders, `From.from` in `?`, integer types other than `U64`.
Differences from rustc: a `&mut` argument is never implicitly reborrowed at a shorter
region (rejected/surface/outlives_wrong_way; rustc accepts it); a borrow's extent is
NLL only for straight-line code (a borrow taken in a branch or a loop body ends with that
statement or block); a block-local `let` that shadows an outer variable stays visible
after the block when the block is in tail position.

## Elaborator issues found (worked around; not wishful features, reported for fixing)

1. **Implicit arguments in a parameter type of an equation-style definition stay
   metavariables.** `def f … (hC : (x : A) → Store.underR k (m x) = C (k x)) : (r : …) → …
   | .ok st, h => … | .err e, h => ()` → "kernel does not accept metavariables (?m1)";
   writing `@Store.underR A B S k (m x)` fixes it (lib/Optic.wiz `underR_pg`/`_pp`).
   The same statement checks as an `axiom` or as a non-matching `def`, so it's the match
   compiler's reverted parameters.
2. **`@f` on the recursive call of an equation-style definition** is "unknown identifier"
   (lowered/05: recursive calls must omit the region argument, which works because it is
   a parameter before the colon).
3. **`.c` constructors inside tuple components** (`.ok (.nil, st)`, `.ok (.true, v)`) get
   no expected type ("no elaborator for syntax kind term.dotIdent"); write `List.nil`,
   `Bool.true`.
4. **Generalised field notation doesn't see through `def`-aliases** (`st.put fin` for
   `st : Store A S` fails; `Store.put st fin` works) — expected, since `Store` is a
   `def`, but it makes the library less pleasant (nominal `structure Store` would fix it
   at the cost of the pair patterns).
5. **Unifier vs computed equations** (see `unify-computed-equations`): every congruence
   in a proof needs all implicit arguments explicit.
6. `match` on a non-variable discriminant doesn't generalise hypotheses that mention it
   (`match List.atL i xs, ih with …`); worked around by stating lemmas over an arbitrary
   `r` and instantiating them (the `Store.underR_*` lemmas). A `match h : e with` form
   would make this direct.

7. **Escapes reported as "rigid mismatch".** When a scope's body returns a handle of the
   scope's region, the error is sometimes "type mismatch … (rigid mismatch)" between two
   metavariables (`Result (?m1 ρ x)` vs `Result (?m5 ρ x ρy hy y)`), not "a variable
   escapes the scope of the hole being solved" (which it does say when the type is
   already concrete). Both are correct rejections; the message should name the escaping
   region. `drafts/feral/rejected/` shows each.
8. **Unannotated scope lambdas** (`fun ρ h v r => …`) check when the expected type is a Π
   with quantity-0 binders: no annotations needed, but the scope's `B` is solved from
   the body, so errors point into it.

## Measurements wanted (not done: no timing claims)

* Allocation/reuse counts (`#run` heap or a future `--stats`) for lowered/04 (expect 0
  allocations in `reverse.loop0`), 05 (closure chain vs zipper), 07 (struct cell reuse).
* The handles are one-field structures, boxed at run time (`#ir`: `proj 0 x1`), so every
  `Uniq`/`Shr`/`Mut` costs a cell and every `Uniq.set` a reuse at best; and the scopes are
  closures (`Uniq.borrow σ s (fun …)`), unless inlined. Wanted: counts before/after this
  change for 01, 02, 07, and either newtype unboxing of one-field structures or inlining
  of the scope combinators.
* Whether the closure form of `get_mut` (03) reuses the vector when compiled; it can't
  natively until `Vec` is native (implemented-by).
